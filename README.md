gas-trello-sync
===============

A Google Apps Script which allows you to create and check progress on many Trello cards at once, across boards.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**
The current repo information is not enough to start using the utility. The Google Spreadsheet structure
is assumed. The template of the script will be available once set up instructions are written.
The goal is that the template is kept up to date with the most recent stable release (tracked by tags).

Issue Tracking
===============

Since this is a Trello utility, it makes sense that the issue tracking is done on Trello.
The board can be found here: https://trello.com/board/google-apps-script-trello-util/4f8892e34262013d04078334

There currently is no plan to open membership of the project, but this will be updated once there is.

Changelog
==============

I honestly don't expect this to be updated, but it's here for what that's worth.
